  "narrative": [
    "I started coding as a teenager and began building production systems long before formal titles mattered. Over the years, I've worked as a founder, CTO, advisor, and hands-on engineer — often stepping in when teams struggled with architecture decisions, execution bottlenecks, or scaling challenges.",
    "Alongside industry work, I've pursued formal training in computer science to deepen how I think about systems. I hold an MTech in Artificial Intelligence and am currently pursuing a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science at IIT Jodhpur.",
    "My research background shapes how I think about correctness, complexity, and long-term trade-offs — but my work remains deeply execution-focused. I care about systems that scale with teams, technology that aligns with business goals, and decisions that still make sense years later."
